# To be used with face_calibration.py to move and scale Quori's eyes programatically: Eyes cannot grow bigger during the gif

0:
  dx: 6   # move in x (positive is right)
  dy: 5    # move in y (positive is down)
  sx: 1.1  # scale in x (make sure you have the space to scale if sx > 1)
  sy: 1.1 # scale in y (make sure you have the space to scale if sy > 1)
1:
  dx: -12
  dy: 12
  sx: 1.09
  sy: 1.09


  # Notes on the calibration transform:
  # sy_0 and sy_1 should be the same as sx_0 and sx_1, but in the talking face the sy needs to be 1.0 
  # dy_1 is usually positive but talking face wanted it negative
  # The sx and sy values added a 0.2 when doing the talking face
